# Varuna-Arduino
Microcontroller side code for an automatic plant watering system. 
It uses the ESP8266 wifi shield connected to Arduino Mega to communicate with an android application, and upon receiving a request from the android application it reads data from KG003 sensor about the moisture content of the soil, and in case a user has requested to water his plants, it triggers a watering system connected to it to put water in the plants if they require it until the moisture sensor indicates the value isn't okay. It then sends a response to the phone containing the moisture content, the temperature content (read using the DS18B20 sensor) and the amount of water given (using the YF-S201 waterflow sensor). In case the user has asked just for the details, then the watering system is not triggered and the response just contains moisture and temperature content.
